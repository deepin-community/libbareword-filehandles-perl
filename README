NAME

    bareword::filehandles - disables bareword filehandles

VERSION

    version 0.007

SYNOPSIS

        no bareword::filehandles;
    
        open FH, $file            # dies
        open my $fh, $file;       # doesn't die
    
        print FH $string          # dies
        print STDERR $string      # doesn't die

DESCRIPTION

    This module lexically disables the use of bareword filehandles with
    builtin functions, except for the special builtin filehandles STDIN,
    STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT and DATA.

METHODS

 unimport

    Disables bareword filehandles for the remainder of the scope being
    compiled.

 import

    Enables bareword filehandles for the remainder of the scope being
    compiled.

LIMITATIONS

    Filetest operators (-X) can not be checked on Perl versions before
    5.32, because hooking the op check function for these breaks stacked
    tests, e.g. -f -w -x $file.

SEE ALSO

    perlfunc, B::Hooks::OP::Check.
